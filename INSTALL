Net::AOLIM Installation Instructions

To install the Net::AOLIM module, you should execute the following
commands:

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install

This will install the module into your standard perl path so that

use Net::AOLIM;

will work properly.

In addition, you may want to copy the file TOC.7 into your man7
directory.  Generally, this will be

/usr/man/man7

or

/usr/local/man/man7

TOC.7 includes information on the TOC protocol, and is the reference
upon which this implementation is based.

The file example.pl is a text-based script that I hacked up to serve
as an example of (one way of) using the module.  Peruse to your
heart's content; it's not well documented, but you should be able to
understand what I'm doing.

If you have any problems, let me know!
